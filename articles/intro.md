Example mods can be found [here](https://github.com/hk-modding/api/tree/master/Examples).

Installing the API
==================
You can use the [installer](https://github.com/fifty-six/Modinstaller2/releases) 
or place the files from an [api release](https://github.com/hk-modding/api/releases) 
into the `Managed` folder of your game install. 

Building the API
===============

**If you want to use the API, for making mods or using them, please use a release or the installer.**

1. Clone the repository!
2. Copy the Managed folder from your Hollow Knight installation into the solution folder and name it Vanilla.
3. Build the solution using an IDE or `dotnet build`.
4. The result will be in `OutputFinal`
